## 🎯 Learning Outcomes by Track

### **After Quick Start:**
```python
# You'll confidently run:
from odibi_de_v2 import run_project
run_project("My Project", "qat", engine="pandas")

# And understand what happens behind the scenes
```

### **After Comprehensive:**
```python
# You'll build complete pipelines:
from odibi_functions import odibi_function

@odibi_function(engine="pandas")
def my_transformation(context, inputs, outputs, **kwargs):
    df = pd.read_csv(inputs[0])
    # Your logic...
    df.to_parquet(outputs[0]['table'])
```

### **After Master:**
```python
# You'll architect entire systems:
from odibi_de_v2.hooks import HookManager
from odibi_de_v2.logging import SQLTableLogSink

hooks = HookManager()
@hooks.on("transform_failure")
def handle_failure(payload):
    # Your recovery logic...

run_project(..., hooks=hooks, log_sink=SQLTableLogSink())
```
