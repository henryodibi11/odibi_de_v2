### `config_loader.py`

#### Function: `load_config_tables_azure`

### Function Overview

The `load_config_tables_azure` function is designed to fetch configuration data for data ingestion sources and targets from an Azure SQL Server database. It returns this data as Pandas DataFrames, facilitating further data manipulation or processing within a Python environment. This function is particularly useful in data engineering workflows where configurations for data sources and targets need to be dynamically loaded and managed within a Spark-based data processing pipeline.

### Inputs and Outputs

**Inputs:**
- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the Azure SQL Server.
- `database`: The name of the database from which configuration data is retrieved.
- `user`: The username for SQL Server authentication.
- `password`: The corresponding password for SQL Server authentication.
- `project`: The project identifier used to filter the configuration data.
- `source_id`: The identifier for the specific source configuration to be fetched.
- `target_id`: The identifier for the specific target configuration to be fetched.
- `spark`: An active SparkSession object, which is used within the function to handle data operations.

**Outputs:**
- A tuple containing two Pandas DataFrames:
  - The first DataFrame holds the source configuration data.
  - The second DataFrame contains the target configuration data.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

1. **SQL Queries:** The function constructs SQL queries to select relevant configuration data from `IngestionSourceConfig` and `IngestionTargetConfig` tables based on the provided `project`, `source_id`, and `target_id`. These queries also join with the `SecretsConfig` table to include necessary authentication and connection details.

2. **Data Handling with Spark:** Although the function returns Pandas DataFrames, it utilizes Spark (via a `SparkSession` object) to initially read data from the SQL Server. This approach leverages Spark's ability to handle large datasets and complex data operations, which is particularly beneficial in a distributed computing environment.

3. **Conversion to Pandas:** After fetching the data with Spark, the function converts the Spark DataFrames to Pandas DataFrames. This conversion allows for easier data manipulation and integration with other Python-based data processing workflows, which often rely on Pandas for data analysis tasks.

4. **Security and Configuration Management:** The function handles sensitive data (e.g., passwords, authentication keys) securely by retrieving such details from a `SecretsConfig` table, minimizing hard-coded sensitive information in the codebase.

### Integration into Larger Applications

This function is likely part of a larger data ingestion or ETL framework where managing multiple data sources and targets dynamically is crucial. It can be used in scenarios where data engineers need to load, refresh, or update ingestion configurations on-the-fly, possibly in response to changes in the data environment or new project requirements.

The function's reliance on both Spark and Pandas makes it suitable for integration into hybrid data processing environments, where both large-scale data handling (with Spark) and detailed, complex data transformations (with Pandas) are required. This makes it a versatile tool in the toolkit of data engineers working with modern data platforms in the cloud, particularly in Azure environments.
