# Module Overview

### `file_utils.py`

#### Function: `get_file_extension`

### Function Overview

The function `get_file_extension` is designed to extract and return the file extension from a given file path string. This utility function is essential for applications that need to handle files differently based on their types or for logging and validation purposes.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Input**: The function accepts a single argument, `path`, which is a string representing the file path from which the file extension needs to be extracted.
- **Output**: It returns a string representing the file extension extracted from the input path. The extension is returned in lowercase without the leading period.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

1. **Use of `os.path.splitext`**: The function utilizes Python's `os` module, specifically `os.path.splitext`, to split the file name from the provided path into a tuple containing the filename and the extension.
2. **String Manipulation**: After splitting the path, the function strips the leading period (.) from the extension using `lstrip(".")` to return a clean extension.
3. **Normalization**: The function converts the extension to lowercase using `lower()` to ensure uniformity, which is particularly useful in environments where file extensions are case-insensitive.

### Integration into Larger Applications

#### Function: `get_stem_name`

### Function Overview

The function `get_stem_name` is designed to extract and return the base name (stem) of a file, excluding its extension, from a provided file path. This is particularly useful in applications where file names need to be manipulated or processed separately from their extensions.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Input**: The function accepts a single input parameter, `path`, which is a string representing the full path of a file.
- **Output**: It returns a string that represents the file name without its extension.

### Key Logic

The function employs two key functions from the `os.path` module:
1. `os.path.basename(path)`: This extracts the last component of the path, effectively isolating the file name with its extension from the full path.
2. `os.path.splitext(path)`: This splits the file name into a tuple containing the file name without the extension (`[0]`) and the extension itself (`[1]`).

By chaining these functions, `get_stem_name` first isolates the file name and then splits it to retrieve and return just the stem (the file name without its extension).

### Integration into Larger Applications

In larger applications, `get_stem_name` can be used in file handling and processing tasks where the extension of the file is irrelevant, or different actions are required based on the file name alone. Examples include:
- Generating new file names while preserving original names.
- Logging or displaying file names without clutter from extensions.
- Grouping or categorizing files based on names without considering their types (extensions).

This function is a utility that enhances readability and maintainability of code dealing with file system paths by abstracting the details of path manipulation.

#### Function: `is_valid_file_path`

### Function Overview

The function `is_valid_file_path` is designed to validate whether a given string can be considered a valid-looking file path. This function is crucial in scenarios where file paths need to be validated before proceeding with file operations, ensuring that the path is not only non-empty but also includes a file name.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Input**: The function accepts a single input parameter, `path`, which is a string representing the file path to be validated.
- **Output**: It returns a boolean value. The function returns `True` if the input string looks like a valid file path, and `False` otherwise.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

1. **Non-Empty Check**: The function first checks if the provided `path` string is non-empty. This is a basic validation to ensure that an empty string is immediately flagged as invalid.
2. **File Name Check**: It uses `os.path.basename(path)` to extract the file name from the path. If the basename is empty, it implies that the path does not end in a file name, which is essential for a valid file path.

### Integration in Applications

This function is particularly useful in applications that need to validate file types before processing to ensure compatibility or adherence to expected input types.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs:**
  - `path` (str): The file path of the file to be checked. This should include the file name and its extension.
  - `supported_formats` (List[str]): A list of strings representing the file extensions that are considered acceptable. Each string in the list should be the extension without the dot (e.g., "csv", "json").

- **Output:**
  - `bool`: The function returns `True` if the file's extension is found in the `supported_formats` list, otherwise `False`.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

1. **Extension Extraction**: The function relies on another function `get_file_extension` to extract the extension from the provided file path. This modular approach allows the extension extraction logic to be reused and potentially replaced without modifying the `is_supported_format` function.

2. **Case Insensitivity**: The function converts all formats in the `supported_formats` list to lowercase before checking for a match. This design choice ensures that the function is case-insensitive, enhancing its robustness against variations in case used in file extensions.

3. **List Comprehension**: The use of list comprehension to convert all formats in the `supported_formats` list to lowercase is a Pythonic way to achieve this transformation succinctly and efficiently.

### Integration into Larger Applications

`is_supported_format` can be integrated into file handling and processing systems where there is a need to validate file types before performing operations such as data parsing, reading, or writing. It helps in enforcing constraints on the types of files an application can accept, thereby preventing errors that might occur from unsupported file formats.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

1. **Splitting the String**: The function uses the `re.split()` method from Python's `re` (regular expressions) module to divide the input string into words. The regular expression `r"[\W_]+"` is used to split the string at any sequence of non-word characters or underscores. This ensures that common delimiters like spaces, punctuation, and special symbols are effectively handled.

2. **Stripping Leading/Trailing Spaces**: Before splitting, any leading or trailing whitespace in the input string is removed using the `strip()` method. This prevents empty strings from being included in the list of words if the input text starts or ends with whitespace.

3. **Constructing the camelCase String**: The first word of the resulting list is converted entirely to lowercase. This is concatenated with the rest of the words, which are converted to "Title Case" (first letter uppercase and the rest lowercase), and then joined together without spaces. This transformation is achieved using a list comprehension combined with the `title()` method for each subsequent word.

### Integration into Larger Applications

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Input**: The function accepts a single input parameter, `text`, which is expected to be a string.
- **Output**: It returns a string that has been converted to PascalCase.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

1. **Word Separation**: The function uses the `re.split` method from Python's `re` (regular expression) module to split the input string into words. The regular expression `r"[\W_]+"` is used to define the split criteria, which matches any sequence of non-word characters or underscores. This allows the function to handle a variety of input strings, including those with punctuation or special characters.

2. **Stripping Whitespace**: Before splitting, the function strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string using the `strip()` method. This ensures that no empty strings are generated from leading or trailing spaces, which could otherwise result in unwanted characters in the output.

3. **Capitalization**: Each word extracted from the input string is converted to title case using the `title()` method. This method capitalizes the first letter of each word and makes all other letters lowercase, which is essential for achieving the PascalCase format.

4. **Concatenation**: Finally, the function concatenates all the title-cased words into a single string without any spaces, producing the final PascalCase result.

  - `False` if the code is running in a non-local environment, specifically in Databricks in this context.

### Key Logic

The function operates by calling another function `is_running_in_databricks()`, which presumably checks for specific indicators that the code is running on the Databricks platform. The `is_local_env()` function then negates the result of `is_running_in_databricks()` to determine the locality of the environment:
- If `is_running_in_databricks()` returns `True` (indicating a Databricks environment), `is_local_env()` returns `False`.
- Conversely, if `is_running_in_databricks()` returns `False`, `is_local_env()` returns `True`, indicating a local environment.

### Integration in Larger Applications

In a larger application, `is_local_env()` can be used to branch logic or configure settings based on the execution environment. For example, it might control logging verbosity, data source selection, or performance optimizations that are only applicable in a local development setting. This function helps in creating flexible codebases that are environment-aware and can dynamically adapt to their runtime conditions.

#### Function: `get_current_env`

### Function Overview

The function `get_current_env()` is designed to determine and return the current execution environment of a Python script or application. This utility function is particularly useful in applications that need to adapt their behavior based on the environment they are running in, such as adjusting configurations, file paths, or logging levels.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs**: The function does not take any parameters.
- **Outputs**: It returns a string that describes the current environment. The possible return values are:
  - `"databricks"`: Indicates the code is running in a Databricks environment.
  - `"local"`: Indicates the code is running either in a local notebook environment or a local non-notebook environment.
  - `"unknown"`: Used as a fallback when the environment does not match any of the predefined cases.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

1. **Environment Detection**:
   - The function first checks if the code is running in Databricks using the `is_running_in_databricks()` function.
   - If not, it then checks if the code is running in any notebook environment or explicitly in a local environment through `is_running_in_notebook()` and `is_local_env()` respectively.
   - If none of these conditions are met, it defaults to returning `"unknown"`.

2. **Modular Checks**:
   - The use of separate functions (`is_running_in_databricks()`, `is_running_in_notebook()`, `is_local_env()`) for checking specific environments suggests a modular design approach. This allows for easier updates and maintenance, as changes to environment detection logic can be isolated to these specific functions.

### Integration into Larger Applications

- **Configuration Management**: This function can be integral in setting up environment-specific configurations dynamically. For instance, different database connections or file paths might be used depending on whether the code is executed locally or in Databricks.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Adjusting the verbosity or destination of logs based on the environment can help in debugging and maintaining applications.
- **Development and Testing**: During development and testing phases, knowing the environment can help simulate different scenarios or activate/deactivate certain features.

### Conclusion

`get_current_env()` serves as a straightforward utility for environment detection within Python applications, promoting dynamic adaptation and smarter configuration management based on the runtime environment. Its modular design for environment checks enhances maintainability and clarity within the codebase.

  - `default (str, optional)`: A default value to return if the environment variable specified by `key` is not found. The default value for `default` is `None`.

- **Outputs**:
  - The function returns the value of the environment variable identified by `key`. If the environment variable is not set, it returns the value specified by the `default` parameter.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

- The function utilizes the `os.getenv` method from Python's standard library, which is a secure and reliable way to access environment variables.
- By providing a `default` parameter, the function allows for graceful handling of cases where the environment variable might not be set, thus avoiding potential errors or exceptions in the application.

### Integration into Larger Applications

- `get_env_variable` can be used in any Python application that requires access to environment variables, such as configurations for database connections, API keys, or other sensitive or configurable data.
- It is particularly useful in settings where the application might be deployed in different environments (development, testing, production), allowing developers to manage environment-specific configurations smoothly.
- This function helps in maintaining clean code by abstracting the retrieval and default handling of environment variables, making the main application code more readable and easier to maintain.

### Example Usage

Here is an example of how `get_env_variable` might be used in a Python application:

```python
storage_account = get_env_variable("STORAGE_ACCOUNT", "default_account")
```

In this example, the application tries to retrieve the `STORAGE_ACCOUNT` environment variable. If it is not set, it defaults to `"default_account"`, ensuring that the application has a value to work with without failing.

### `method_chain.py`

#### Function: `apply_dynamic_method`

### Function Overview

The function `apply_dynamic_method` is designed to dynamically invoke a specified method on an object with a flexible argument structure. This utility function is particularly useful in scenarios where the method to be called and the type of arguments are determined at runtime, supporting a wide range of use cases such as dynamic dispatch, API calls, or adaptable data processing pipelines.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs:**
  - `obj (Any)`: The target object on which the method might be applied. This parameter is not used within the function itself, suggesting its inclusion for potential extension or compatibility with object methods.
  - `method (Callable)`: The method or function to be executed. This should be a callable object.
  - `args (Union[dict, list, tuple, Any])`: The arguments to pass to the method. The type of this parameter determines how the arguments are passed to the method:
    - `dict`: Passed as keyword arguments.
    - `list` or `tuple`: Passed as positional arguments.
    - Other types: Passed directly as a single argument.

- **Output:**
  - The function returns the result of the method call, which can be of any type depending on what the method returns.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

- **Dynamic Argument Handling:** The function intelligently handles different types of argument structures, allowing the caller to specify arguments in the form that best suits their needs. This design enhances the function's flexibility and makes it adaptable to various calling contexts.
- **Type Checking:** The function uses `isinstance` checks to determine the type of the `args` parameter and routes it appropriately as either keyword arguments, positional arguments, or a single argument. This ensures that the method is called in a way that aligns with how its parameters are expected to be received.

### Integration into Larger Applications

`apply_dynamic_method` can be a core utility in applications that require high levels of flexibility in method invocation, such as:
- **Plugin Systems:** Where actions might be defined at runtime and need to be invoked dynamically.
- **API Wrappers:** Dynamically calling different API methods based on runtime decisions.

This function abstracts the complexity of method invocation with variable argument structures, making it easier to develop higher-level functionalities that are clean and maintainable.

#### Function: `run_method_chain`

### Function Overview

The `run_method_chain` function is designed to dynamically apply a sequence of method calls to an object, using a specified dictionary that maps method names to their corresponding arguments. This function is particularly useful for objects with a rich API, such as pandas DataFrames, where multiple transformations might need to be applied in a sequence.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs:**
  - `obj (Any)`: The target object on which the methods will be applied. This object should support the methods specified in the `methods_with_args` dictionary.
  - `methods_with_args (dict)`: A dictionary where keys are the names of methods to be called on `obj`, and values are the arguments for each method. These arguments can be provided as dictionaries (for keyword arguments), lists/tuples (for positional arguments), or single values if the method requires only one argument.
  - `validate (bool, optional)`: A flag to specify whether the function should validate that the provided arguments match the method signatures of the object. Defaults to `False`.

- **Output:**
  - Returns the modified object after all specified methods have been applied.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

- **Method Validation:** Before applying a method, the function checks if the method exists on the object. If `validate` is `True`, it further checks if the provided arguments match the method's signature. This helps in catching errors early and ensures that the method calls are compatible with the object.
  
- **Dynamic Method Application:** The function uses `getattr` to dynamically access methods on the object based on the string names provided in the `methods_with_args` dictionary. This allows for flexible and dynamic manipulation of objects based on external specifications (e.g., configuration files or user inputs).

- **Error Handling:** If a method application fails, the function logs detailed error information and raises a `ValueError`. This robust error handling makes the function suitable for use in larger applications where stability and reliability are critical.

### Integration in Larger Applications

The `run_method_chain` function is ideal for scenarios where an object needs to undergo a series of transformations that are dynamically specified at runtime. This could be particularly useful in data processing pipelines, automated reporting systems, or web applications where user inputs dictate the transformations applied to data models. By encapsulating the method application logic in a single function, `run_method_chain` contributes to cleaner, more maintainable code and reduces the risk of runtime errors in dynamic method execution scenarios.

### `type_checks.py`

#### Function: `is_empty_dict`

### Function Overview

The function `is_empty_dict` is designed to determine whether a given object is an empty dictionary. This utility function is useful in applications where it's necessary to validate the type and state of data structures, ensuring they meet expected criteria before proceeding with further operations.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Input**: The function accepts a single parameter `d`, which can be any Python object (`Any` type hint).
- **Output**: It returns a boolean value (`bool`). The function outputs `True` if the input `d` is both a dictionary and empty, and `False` otherwise.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

1. **Type Checking**: The function uses `isinstance(d, dict)` to check if the input `d` is of type `dict`. This ensures that the function specifically verifies dictionaries, ignoring other data types.
2. **Empty Check**: The function checks if the dictionary is empty by evaluating the truthiness of `d`. In Python, an empty dictionary evaluates to `False`. Therefore, `not d` will be `True` for empty dictionaries.

### Integration into Larger Applications

`is_empty_dict` can be integrated into larger applications where data validation and type safety are crucial. For example:
- In a configuration management system, ensuring that certain settings are not left uninitialized.

  - `obj (Any)`: The object to be checked. This parameter can accept any data type.
  - `expected_types (tuple)`: A tuple containing the data types against which the object `obj` is to be checked. Each element in the tuple is a type.

- **Output**:
  - `bool`: The function returns `True` if the object `obj` is an instance of any type within `expected_types`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

#### Key Logic
The function utilizes Python's built-in `isinstance()` function to determine if `obj` is an instance of any type specified in `expected_types`. The use of `isinstance()` is a standard and efficient way to check an object's type in Python, supporting checks against multiple types in a single call by passing a tuple of types.

#### Integration in Larger Applications
In larger applications or modules, `is_valid_type` can be integrated as a part of input validation systems, configuration parsers, or anywhere data integrity needs to be ensured before further processing. It helps in maintaining robustness and reliability of the application by guarding against type mismatches and related runtime errors.

#### Example Usage

#### Key Logic
- The function uses `isinstance(value, str)` to check if the input is of type string.
- It employs `value.strip() != ""` to ensure the string is not empty or just whitespace. The `strip()` method removes leading and trailing whitespace, making the function robust against inputs like `" "` or `"\t"`.

#### Integration into Larger Applications
In larger applications or modules, `is_non_empty_string` can serve as a foundational utility for:
- Validating form inputs in web applications to ensure meaningful string data is provided.
- Pre-processing data in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines to verify and clean string inputs.
- Enforcing data quality checks in applications that store or manage textual data.

This function helps maintain data quality and integrity by ensuring that strings are both present and significant, thereby preventing errors and inconsistencies in downstream processing or storage operations.

### `validation_utils.py`

#### Function: `validate_required_keys`

### Function Overview

The function `validate_required_keys` is designed to verify the presence of specified keys in a given dictionary. This utility is crucial for data validation processes where certain keys are mandatory for the correct functioning of an application or module.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs:**
  - `data` (dict): The dictionary to be checked.
  - `required_keys` (List[str]): A list of strings representing the keys that must be present in the dictionary.

- **Output:**
  - Returns a boolean (`bool`): `True` if all required keys are found in the dictionary, `False` otherwise.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

The function employs a straightforward and efficient approach using Python's `all()` function combined with a generator expression. This checks for the existence of each key from `required_keys` in the `data` dictionary. The use of `all()` ensures that the function will return `False` as soon as a required key is missing, making the function efficient by not checking remaining keys unnecessarily.

### Integration into Larger Applications

`validate_required_keys` can be integrated into any application or module where data integrity and structure validation are necessary. For instance, it can be used in:
- API data validation to ensure incoming JSON payloads contain all necessary keys.
- Configuration file validation to ensure all required settings are present before application startup.
- Data processing scripts that require certain keys to be present in data dictionaries for correct processing.

This function is particularly useful in scenarios where the absence of specific keys could lead to failures or incorrect behavior, thus acting as a preliminary check before further processing or operations are performed.

#### Function: `validate_columns_exist`

### Function Overview

The function `validate_columns_exist` is designed to verify the presence of specified columns in a DataFrame-like object. This function is versatile as it supports different types of DataFrame representations commonly used in data manipulation and analysis libraries such as Pandas and PySpark.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs:**
  - `df_like (Any)`: This parameter accepts any object that resembles a DataFrame. The function is designed to handle objects that either directly have a `columns` attribute (like Pandas DataFrames) or have a `schema` attribute with a `names` sub-attribute (like Spark DataFrames).
  - `required_columns (List[str])`: A list of strings specifying the names of the columns that need to be checked for existence in the `df_like` object.

- **Output:**
  - `bool`: The function returns a Boolean value. It returns `True` if all the columns listed in `required_columns` are found in the `df_like` object; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

- The function first checks if the `df_like` object has the `columns` attribute. If it does, it uses this attribute directly.
- If the `columns` attribute is not present, the function then checks for a `schema` attribute, and subsequently for a `names` attribute within `schema`. This is typical for Spark DataFrames where the schema of the DataFrame is explicitly defined.
- The function uses a list comprehension combined with the `all()` function to determine if every column listed in `required_columns` exists within the `column_list` extracted from the `df_like` object.

### Integration into Larger Applications

This function can be a critical component in data processing pipelines and data validation tasks where ensuring data integrity and structure is necessary before performing further operations. It can be used as a preliminary check in functions that manipulate, analyze, or transform data to prevent errors due to missing columns. This is particularly useful in environments dealing with dynamic or varying data sources where the structure might not be consistent.

### Example Usage

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'id': [1, 2, 3],
    'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
})

# Validate columns
is_valid = validate_columns_exist(df, ['id', 'name'])
print(is_valid)  # Output: True
```

This function is crucial for applications that need to handle files in specific formats, ensuring that operations such as reading, writing, or processing are performed only on compatible file types.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs**:
  - `path` (str): The file path of the file to be validated. This should be a string representing the full path or relative path to the file.
  - `supported_formats` (List[str]): A list of strings where each string is a file extension that the application supports. Extensions should be provided without the leading dot (e.g., "csv" not ".csv").

- **Output**:
  - The function returns a boolean (`bool`). It returns `True` if the file's extension matches one of the entries in `supported_formats`, otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Key Logic

The function delegates the actual checking of the file format to another function `is_supported_format`, which is not defined in the provided code snippet but is assumed to perform the necessary validation. This design choice suggests a modular approach where `is_supported_format` could be a utility function used across different parts of the application to maintain consistency in how file formats are validated.

### Integration in Larger Applications

In a larger application, `validate_supported_format` can be part of a file handling module or a pre-processing step in data ingestion workflows, where it's important to verify that incoming data files are in expected formats before any processing or analysis is performed. This helps in avoiding errors and exceptions at later stages of the workflow.

### Example Usage

Here is a simple example of how this function might be used in a script:

```python
file_path = "example/data.json"
if validate_supported_format(file_path, ["csv", "json", "xml"]):
    print("File format is supported.")
else:
    print("Unsupported file format.")
```

This function is essential for ensuring that the application handles files safely and efficiently, adhering to expected data formats and thereby reducing runtime errors related to file format issues.

#### Function: `validate_non_empty_dict`

### Function Overview

The function `validate_non_empty_dict` is designed to ensure that a provided dictionary is not empty. It is typically used in scenarios where a non-empty dictionary is crucial for the correct execution of a program, such as configuration settings or input data validation.

  - `d (dict)`: The dictionary that needs to be validated.
  - `context (str)`: A string that provides context about the validation scenario, used primarily for error messaging.

- **Outputs:**
  - The function does not return any value. Its primary purpose is to perform a check and potentially raise an exception.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

- The function checks if the dictionary `d` is empty by calling another function `is_empty_dict`. This design choice modularizes the check, making the code more maintainable and reusable.
- If `d` is found to be empty, the function raises a `ValueError` with a message that incorporates the `context` string to provide a clear and contextual error message. This helps in understanding the error's origin when reading logs or debugging.

### Integration in Larger Applications

- `validate_non_empty_dict` can be integrated into any part of an application where dictionaries are used and need to be guaranteed non-empty for correct operation. Examples include:
  - Validating configurations loaded at the start of an application.
  - Checking input data in a data processing pipeline to ensure it meets expected criteria.
  - Ensuring that responses from external APIs or internal function calls contain data before further processing.

This function is particularly useful in robust applications where failing early and clearly (by providing contextual error messages) can prevent more complex issues down the line.

#### Function: `validate_method_exists`

### Function Overview

The `validate_method_exists` function is designed to check whether a specified method exists on a given object. If the method does not exist, the function logs a warning message. This utility function is primarily used for validation purposes within a larger application to ensure that objects conform to expected interfaces or behaviors before they are used in a context-dependent manner.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs**:
  - `obj (Any)`: The object on which the method existence is to be validated. This can be any Python object.
  - `method_name (str)`: The name of the method that needs to be checked on the object.
  - `context (str)`: A string providing context where this validation is being performed. This is used primarily for logging purposes to help identify where the check was invoked.

- **Output**:
  - The function does not return any value (`None`). It performs a side effect by logging a warning if the specified method does not exist on the object.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

- The function uses the `hasattr` built-in function to check if the object (`obj`) has an attribute with the name given by `method_name`. This is a straightforward and efficient way to check for the existence of an attribute or method.
- If the method does not exist, the function constructs a warning message indicating the missing method and the type of the object. This message includes the `context` to provide additional information about the scenario in which the check was performed.
- Logging is handled by a separate function `log_and_optionally_raise`, which is not defined in the provided code but is assumed to handle logging based on various parameters such as module, component, method (context), error type, message, log level, and whether to raise an exception. This design choice abstracts the logging mechanism away from the validation logic, adhering to the single responsibility principle.

### Integration into Larger Applications

- **Modular Design**: The function is part of a utility module (`validation_utils`) and can be easily reused across different parts of an application to ensure that objects meet expected criteria before proceeding with operation-specific logic.
- **Error Handling**: By logging warnings instead of raising exceptions by default, the function allows the calling code to continue execution even if the validation fails. This is suitable for scenarios where non-critical features can be skipped without halting the application.
- **Customizability**: The function supports customization of the logging behavior through the `log_and_optionally_raise` function, which can potentially raise exceptions if needed, based on additional parameters.

In summary, `validate_method_exists` is a utility function intended for use in scenarios where it's crucial to verify that an object implements certain methods, providing robustness and error handling in a modular and reusable manner within larger software systems.

#### Function: `validate_kwargs_match_signature`

### Function Overview

The function `validate_kwargs_match_signature` is designed to ensure that the keyword arguments (`kwargs`) provided to a specific method align with the method's expected parameters. This function is particularly useful in scenarios where dynamic argument passing is involved, and it helps maintain robustness and correctness in the handling of function calls.

### Inputs

- **method (Callable):** The target method whose parameters are to be validated against the provided `kwargs`.
- **kwargs (dict):** A dictionary of keyword arguments that are intended to be passed to the `method`.
- **method_name (str):** A string representing the name of the method; used primarily for logging and error reporting.
- **context (str):** Describes the context in which the validation is being performed, such as the name of the parent function or component. This is also used in logging and error handling.
- **raise_error (bool, optional):** A flag that determines whether a `ValueError` should be raised if invalid keyword arguments are found. Defaults to `True`.

### Key Logic

1. **Parameter Extraction:** The function first retrieves the signature of the provided `method` using `inspect.signature` to determine the valid parameters.
2. **Validation:** It then checks each key in `kwargs` against these valid parameters to identify any that do not belong.
3. **Error Handling:** If invalid keyword arguments are detected and `raise_error` is `True`, the function logs the error and raises a `ValueError`. If `raise_error` is `False`, it only logs the error.

### Outputs

- The function does not return any value (`None`). Its primary output is the side effect of logging and potentially raising an exception if discrepancies are found.

### Integration in Larger Applications

This function is likely part of a larger utility or validation module used across an application to ensure API or method calls are correctly parameterized. This is particularly critical in dynamic environments where methods might be called with varying arguments, or in systems that heavily utilize reflection or metaprogramming techniques. By centralizing this validation logic, the function aids in maintaining code integrity and reducing runtime errors due to incorrect argument passing.

### Example Usage

```python
def greet(name, age): pass

# Correct usage
validate_kwargs_match_signature(greet, {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, "greet", "example")

# Incorrect usage, raises ValueError
validate_kwargs_match_signature(greet, {"foo": 123}, "greet", "example")
```

In summary, `validate_kwargs_match_signature` is a utility function for validating that the keyword arguments provided to a function match its signature, enhancing error handling and logging capabilities in software applications.

---

### `type_enforcement.py`

#### Function: `enforce_types`

### Summary of `enforce_types` Decorator

#### Purpose
The `enforce_types` function is a decorator designed to enforce type hints specified in function signatures at runtime. This helps in maintaining type safety in a Python application, which is dynamically typed by default.

#### Behavior and Inputs
- **Parameter**: The decorator accepts a single optional parameter, `strict` (boolean). 
  - If `strict` is set to `True`, the decorator raises a `TypeError` when the type of an argument does not match its specified type hint.
  - If `strict` is set to `False`, it logs a warning message instead of raising an error. The logging is handled by a function `_log_type_warning`, which is not defined in the provided code but is assumed to exist elsewhere in the application.

#### Key Logic
- The decorator first retrieves the function's signature and binds the actual arguments passed to the function to their respective names.
- It then applies default values for any parameters that were not explicitly passed.
- For each argument, the decorator checks if a type hint exists. If it does, it verifies whether the argument's type matches the expected type hint using a helper function `_matches_type`.
- Depending on the `strict` mode, it either raises a `TypeError` with a detailed message or logs a warning if the types do not match.

#### Design Choices
- The use of Python's `signature` and `get_type_hints` functions allows the decorator to dynamically inspect function arguments and their annotations at runtime.
- The decision to optionally raise an error or log a warning provides flexibility, making the decorator suitable for both development (strict error checking) and production environments (logging without interruption).

#### Integration in Applications
- This decorator can be applied to any function or method where type validation is necessary, enhancing robustness and reliability of the code by catching type mismatches early.
- It is particularly useful in large-scale applications or libraries where maintaining correct types across various modules and functions is critical for functionality and maintenance.

#### Example Usage
```python
@enforce_types(strict=True)
def process_data(data: list, repeat: int) -> None:
    # Function logic here
    pass
```
In this example, calling `process_data` with non-list or non-int types for `data` or `repeat`, respectively, will raise a `TypeError` if `strict` is `True`, ensuring that the function operates with the correct types.

#### Function: `_log_type_warning`

### Function: `_log_type_warning`

#### Purpose:
The `_log_type_warning` function is designed to handle type-related errors within an application by logging them as exceptions. It is primarily used to enforce type constraints and ensure that the application fails gracefully when encountering type mismatches.

#### Inputs:
- `method` (str): The name of the method where the type error occurred. This parameter is intended to provide context in the logged error message but is currently not utilized in the function's body.
- `message` (str): A descriptive message that details the nature of the type error. This message is used to inform the developer or user about what went wrong.

#### Behavior:
- When called, the function raises a `TypeError` with the provided `message`. Despite the function's name suggesting that it logs warnings, it actually raises an exception, which could terminate the program or be caught by higher-level error handling logic.

#### Key Design Choices:
- The function's name (`_log_type_warning`) may be misleading as it directly raises an exception rather than logging a warning. This could be a point of confusion and might warrant renaming or a change in functionality to align with its name.
- The use of a leading underscore in the function name suggests that it is intended for internal use within a module or package, signaling that it is not part of the public API and should not be used directly by external consumers.

#### Integration in a Larger Application:
- `_log_type_warning` is likely part of a larger error handling or validation framework within the application. It helps maintain robustness by enforcing type safety across different parts of the application.
- By centralizing type error handling in one function, the application can maintain consistency in how type errors are managed, making the codebase easier to maintain and debug.

#### Conclusion:
This function is crucial for enforcing type safety in an application, although its current implementation and naming might require adjustments to better reflect its functionality and usage within the broader system.

#### Function: `_matches_type`

### Function Overview

The function `_matches_type` is designed to verify if a given value conforms to a specified type, including complex types like lists, dictionaries, and unions. This function is particularly useful in applications that require strict type checking, such as data validation in APIs, configuration management systems, or during deserialization of data where type integrity is crucial.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs:**
  - `value`: The data whose type needs to be validated.
  - `expected_type`: The type against which the value is checked. This can be a simple type like `int`, `str`, or complex types like `Union`, `list`, `dict`.

- **Outputs:**
  - The function returns a boolean value: `True` if the `value` matches the `expected_type`, otherwise `False`.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

1. **Handling of Union Types:**
   - If the `expected_type` is a `Union`, the function checks if the `value` matches any of the types within the union. This is done using a recursive call to `_matches_type` for each type in the union.

2. **Handling of List Types:**
   - If the `expected_type` is a `list`, the function first checks if the `value` is a list. It then checks each element of the list to ensure all elements are of the type specified in `expected_type`.

3. **Handling of Dictionary Types:**
   - For dictionaries, the function verifies that the `value` is a dictionary and then checks each key-value pair to ensure they match the specified key and value types in `expected_type`.

4. **Handling of NoneType:**
   - Directly checks if the `value` is `None` when `expected_type` is `type(None)`.

5. **General Type Checking:**
   - For other types, it simply uses `isinstance` to check if the `value` is an instance of `expected_type`.

### Integration into Larger Applications

This function can be integrated into any system where type safety and validation are necessary. It can be particularly useful in:
- **Data Validation:** Ensuring incoming data in web applications matches expected schemas.
- **Configuration Validation:** Verifying configuration objects in software applications.
- **Data Parsing and Serialization:** Ensuring that data being serialized/deserialized matches the expected structure, especially in dynamically typed languages.

### Conclusion

The `_matches_type` function is a versatile utility for robust type checking across simple and complex data types, enhancing the reliability and stability of applications by ensuring data integrity through strict type validation.

#### Function: `_type_to_str`

### Function: `_type_to_str`

#### Purpose
The `_type_to_str` function is designed to convert a type object into a more readable string format, specifically by removing the `typing.` prefix that is commonly present in type hints from the `typing` module in Python. This function is typically used to simplify the display or logging of type information, making it more user-friendly.

#### Inputs
- `tp`: A type object. This can be any object representing a type, including those from the `typing` module (e.g., `typing.List`, `typing.Dict`).

#### Outputs
- Returns a string representation of the input type object. If the type object includes the prefix `typing.`, this prefix is removed to simplify the output.

#### Key Logic
- The function attempts to convert the type object `tp` to a string.
- If the conversion is successful and the string contains the prefix `typing.`, this prefix is stripped from the string to make the type name cleaner and more readable.
- If an exception occurs during the conversion (though unlikely in typical use cases), the function falls back to returning the string representation of the type without attempting to modify it.

#### Design Choices
- The use of a try-except block ensures robustness by handling potential exceptions during type conversion, although such exceptions are rare with standard type objects.
- The function is prefixed with an underscore (`_`), suggesting that it is intended for internal use within a module or package rather than being part of the public API.

#### Integration in Larger Applications
- This function is useful in scenarios where type information needs to be displayed to users or logged in a simplified format without the verbose `typing.` prefix.
- It can be particularly helpful in debugging, logging frameworks, or any tools that perform type introspection and need to present type information in a clean and concise manner.
- In larger applications, `_type_to_str` might be part of a utility module for handling and manipulating type information across various components of the application.

### `benchmark.py`

#### Function: `benchmark`

### Function Overview

The `benchmark` function is a Python decorator designed to measure and log the execution time of any function it decorates. It is particularly useful for performance monitoring in larger applications, allowing developers to track how long specific functions take to execute.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs:**
  - `module` (str): A string representing the name of the top-level module where the decorated function resides. Defaults to "UNKNOWN" if not specified.
  - `component` (str): A string representing the name of the submodule or component within the module. Defaults to "unknown" if not provided.

- **Outputs:**
  - The decorator returns a callable, which is the wrapped version of the original function that includes benchmarking logic.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

- **Timing Execution:** When the decorated function is called, the decorator records the start time, executes the function, and then records the end time. The duration of the function's execution is calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time.
  
- **Logging:** After calculating the duration, the decorator logs this information using a hypothetical `log_and_optionally_raise` function. This function logs the execution time along with the module and component names, and the name of the function. The log level is set to "INFO".

- **Function Wrapping:** The decorator uses the `wraps` function from the `functools` module, which is a common practice to preserve the metadata of the original function (like its name and docstring).

### Integration into Larger Applications

The `benchmark` decorator can be seamlessly integrated into any Python application where performance metrics are crucial. It is particularly useful in scenarios where different components or stages of an application might have varying performance characteristics that need monitoring and optimization. By specifying the `module` and `component` parameters, developers can categorize and filter performance logs more effectively, aiding in quicker diagnostics and optimizations.

### Usage Example

```python
@benchmark(module="DATA_PROCESSING", component="loading_stage")
def load_data(source):
    # Function logic here
    pass
```

In this example, every call to `load_data` will be timed, and the execution duration will be logged under the "DATA_PROCESSING" module and "loading_stage" component, providing clear insights into the performance of this particular function.

### `ensure_output_type.py`

#### Function: `ensure_output_type`

### Function Overview

The `ensure_output_type` function is a decorator factory designed to enforce type consistency by ensuring that the return value of the decorated function matches a specified type. This is particularly useful in applications where strict data types are necessary to maintain integrity and prevent runtime errors, such as in data processing pipelines or APIs.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Input:** 
  - `expected_type (type)`: This is the type that the decorated function's return value is expected to match. It can be any Python type (e.g., `int`, `str`, `list`) or a more complex type like `pd.DataFrame`.

- **Output:** 
  - The decorator returns a wrapped version of the original function that includes type checking logic.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

1. **Type Checking:** After the decorated function executes, the result is checked against the `expected_type`. If the result does not match the expected type, a detailed error message is logged. This is crucial for debugging and maintaining code quality in development environments.

2. **Error Handling:** Instead of raising an exception directly, the function logs an error message using a hypothetical `_log_output_type_error` function. This approach allows the application to continue running while still reporting type mismatches, which might be preferable in production environments where stopping execution on the first type error isn't desired.

3. **Decorator Factory:** `ensure_output_type` uses a nested decorator pattern. This allows the decorator to accept parameters (in this case, the `expected_type`) and apply them to the logic of the inner decorator.

### Integration into Larger Applications

In larger applications or modules, `ensure_output_type` can be used to enforce data contracts between different parts of the system. For example, in a data analysis application, it could be used to ensure that data transformation functions return `pandas.DataFrame` objects as expected, preventing downstream errors in data analysis or visualization stages.

This decorator helps in maintaining robustness and reliability of the code by catching type mismatches early in the development or testing phase, thus reducing bugs and potential failures in production environments.

#### Function: `_log_output_type_error`

### Function Documentation: `_log_output_type_error`

#### Purpose
The `_log_output_type_error` function is designed to handle and raise a `TypeError` with a specific error message. This function is typically used in a larger application or module to enforce type safety by ensuring that the types of the outputs or variables meet expected criteria. It acts as a centralized method for error handling related to type mismatches, improving the maintainability and consistency of error management across the application.

#### Inputs
- `method` (str): The name of the method or function where the type error occurred. This parameter is currently not used within the function but can be included in future enhancements to log or handle errors more specifically based on the method context.
- `message` (str): A descriptive message that explains the nature of the type error. This message is passed directly to the `TypeError` that is raised, providing clarity on what went wrong when the error is caught and debugged.

#### Behavior
- The function does not return any value. Instead, it raises a `TypeError` with the provided `message`. This exception should be caught and handled where the function is called, allowing for appropriate responses such as logging the error, user notifications, or other error recovery mechanisms.

#### Key Design Choices
- The use of a dedicated function to raise type errors centralizes error handling logic, making it easier to modify error handling behavior from a single location.
- The function is prefixed with an underscore (`_`), indicating that it is intended for internal use within the module or package and should not be used directly by external modules or users.

#### Integration in Larger Application
In a larger application, `_log_output_type_error` can be called from various points where type checks are necessary. By using this function, developers ensure that all type-related errors are handled consistently and that the error messages are clear and informative. This function can be part of a larger error handling or logging framework within the application, contributing to robust and reliable software behavior.

### `log_call.py`

#### Function: `log_call`

### Function Overview

The `log_call` function is a decorator designed to log details about function calls, including the function name and its arguments. It is particularly useful for tracking and debugging function executions within larger applications, especially those with complex interactions between multiple modules and components.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs:**
  - `module (str)`: A string representing the name of the top-level module where the decorated function resides. Default is "UNKNOWN".
  - `component (str)`: A string representing the name of the submodule or component. Default is "unknown".

These inputs are used to specify the context in which the function is being called, aiding in more granular logging.

- **Output:**
  - The decorator returns a callable, specifically the wrapped function with enhanced logging functionality.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

1. **Function Wrapping**: The decorator defines an inner function `wrapper` that wraps the original function `func`. This wrapper intercepts calls to `func`, allowing the decorator to inject logging logic before the actual function execution.

2. **Argument Logging**:
   - The function uses Python's `inspect.signature` to obtain the function signature of `func` and binds the actual call arguments to this signature.
   - Default values are applied to any missing arguments using `bound.apply_defaults()`.
   - The arguments are then formatted into a string, excluding 'self' to avoid redundancy when logging methods of classes.

3. **Logging Mechanism**:
   - The function `log_and_optionally_raise` (assumed to be defined elsewhere) is called with the module, component, method name, and a formatted message containing the function call details.
   - The logging level is set to "INFO", indicating that the logs are primarily informational.

### Integration into Larger Applications

- **Modular Logging**: By specifying `module` and `component`, the decorator allows for structured logging across different parts of an application. This can be crucial for large-scale applications with multiple interacting modules.
- **Debugging and Monitoring**: The detailed logging of function calls and their arguments aids in debugging and monitoring the application's behavior, especially during development or in production environments where tracing issues across multiple services or components can be challenging.
- **Flexibility**: The decorator can be easily applied to any function with minimal changes to existing code, making it a versatile tool for enhancing logging without disrupting existing functionalities.

### Usage Example

```python
@log_call(module="INGESTION", component="reader")
def read_data(path: str):
    # Function implementation
```

This example shows how `log_call` can be used to log all calls to `read_data`, including the path argument it was called with, under the INGESTION module and reader component. This aids in tracking how data reading is performed and debugging issues related to data ingestion.

### `validate_schema.py`

#### Function: `validate_schema`

### Summary of `validate_schema` Function

#### Purpose
The `validate_schema` function is designed to ensure that a DataFrame passed to another function contains specific required columns. It acts as a decorator to validate the schema of the DataFrame before the execution of the function it decorates.

#### Inputs
- `required_columns` (list[str]): A list of strings specifying the names of the columns that must be present in the DataFrame.
- `param_name` (str, optional): The name of the parameter in the decorated function that is expected to contain the DataFrame. The default value is "df".

#### Behavior and Key Logic
- **Decorator Creation**: `validate_schema` is a decorator factory, meaning it returns a decorator (`decorator`) that can then be applied to a function.
- **Function Wrapping**: The decorator wraps the target function (`func`) with additional pre-execution logic that checks the DataFrame's schema.
- **Parameter Handling**: It uses Python's `inspect.signature` to bind and retrieve the actual argument passed to the parameter named `param_name` in the decorated function.
- **Validation**: The function checks if the DataFrame:
  1. Exists and is a valid DataFrame-like object (i.e., has a `columns` attribute).
  2. Contains all the columns listed in `required_columns`.
- **Error Logging**: If the DataFrame is missing any required columns or is not a valid DataFrame, it logs a schema violation using a hypothetical `_log_schema_violation` function (not implemented in the provided code). This function logs issues with the method name and a specific message.
- **Continuation**: If the DataFrame passes all checks, the original function (`func`) is called with its arguments.

#### Integration into Larger Applications
- **Data Validation**: This function is particularly useful in data processing applications where data integrity and specific schema compliance are crucial, such as in data transformation pipelines, ETL processes, or when preparing data for machine learning models.
- **Error Handling**: By checking DataFrame schemas at runtime, the function helps prevent common errors due to missing data, thereby making debugging and maintenance easier.
- **Customizability**: The flexibility to specify the parameter name and required columns makes this decorator adaptable to different functions and DataFrame structures within a larger Python application.

#### Example Usage
The function can be used as follows to ensure that a DataFrame passed to `clean_data` contains 'id' and 'timestamp' columns:
```python
@validate_schema(["id", "timestamp"])
def clean_data(df):
    # Function implementation
    pass
```
This setup helps in maintaining robust data handling practices across diverse data-centric applications.

#### Function: `_log_schema_violation`

### Function: `_log_schema_violation`

#### Purpose:
The `_log_schema_violation` function is designed to handle schema violations by raising an exception when such a violation is detected. This function is typically used in the context of data validation within an application, ensuring that data conforms to a predefined schema or set of rules.

#### Inputs:
- `method` (str): A string representing the name of the method or operation where the schema violation occurred. This parameter is currently not used within the function but could be useful for future enhancements, such as logging the method name along with the error message.
- `message` (str): A descriptive message detailing the nature of the schema violation. This message is used to provide clarity on what specific rule or expectation was violated.

#### Behavior:
- When called, the function raises a `ValueError` with the provided `message`. This interrupts the normal flow of execution and transfers control to the nearest exception handler for `ValueError`. This behavior enforces strict adherence to the schema by halting execution when a violation is detected.

#### Key Design Choices:
- The function uses a straightforward approach to error handling by using Python's built-in `ValueError`. This choice leverages Python's exception handling framework and makes the function's behavior predictable and consistent with common Python practices.
- The function is prefixed with an underscore (`_`), suggesting that it is intended for internal use within the module or package and not part of the public API.

#### Integration in a Larger Application:
- `_log_schema_violation` is likely part of a larger data validation framework where each component or function is responsible for checking different aspects of data against specific schemas.
- It can be integrated into data processing pipelines, form validation logic, or during the ingestion of external data sources, where adherence to a specific schema is critical.
- The function's design allows it to be easily adapted or extended, for example, to include logging to external systems or incorporating more detailed diagnostic information in the exception message.

### `validate_input_types.py`

#### Function: `validate_input_types`

### Function Overview

The `validate_input_types` function is designed to ensure that function arguments in Python match expected data types. It is implemented as a decorator, which can be applied to any function to enforce type checking of its parameters.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Input**: The primary input to `validate_input_types` is a dictionary (`expected_types`) where each key-value pair specifies the name of an argument and the type that argument is expected to be.

- **Output**: This decorator does not modify the output of the function it decorates. Instead, it either allows the function to execute normally if type validations pass, or it raises a `TypeError` if any argument does not match its expected type.

### Key Logic and Design Choices

1. **Decorator Design**: `validate_input_types` uses a nested function structure typical of decorators. The outer function takes configuration parameters (in this case, `expected_types`), and the inner `wrapper` function handles the logic applied to the decorated function.

2. **Type Checking**: Before the decorated function executes, the `wrapper` function checks each expected argument against its provided type. This is done by binding the actual input arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`) to the formal parameters of the function and then comparing their types to the expected types.

3. **Error Handling**: If an argument's type does not match the expected type, a `TypeError` is raised with a detailed error message specifying the mismatch. This proactive error handling helps in debugging and maintaining type integrity in dynamic languages like Python.

4. **Integration with Function Signatures**: The use of `inspect.signature` allows the decorator to be flexible and applicable to any function, regardless of how its arguments are passed (positional or keyword).

### Application in Larger Systems

In larger applications or modules, `validate_input_types` can be crucial for ensuring that functions receive the correct types of inputs, especially in dynamically typed environments where such errors might otherwise occur at runtime. This can be particularly useful in data processing, web application backends, and any other context where functions are expected to handle specific types of data structures.

By enforcing type constraints, this decorator aids in maintaining robustness and reliability of code, making it easier to debug and preventing type-related errors early in the execution process. This is especially beneficial in large codebases or in systems where inputs might vary dynamically.

#### Function: `_log_input_type_error`

### Function Documentation: `_log_input_type_error`

#### Purpose
The `_log_input_type_error` function is designed to handle and raise a `TypeError` within a Python application, specifically when an incorrect input type is encountered. This function centralizes the error handling for type-related issues, ensuring that such errors are managed consistently across the application.

#### Inputs
- **method** (`str`): The name of the method or function where the type error occurred. This parameter is currently not used in the function body but could be useful for future enhancements, such as logging the method name along with the error message.
- **message** (`str`): A descriptive message that details the nature of the type error. This message is passed directly to the `TypeError` that is raised, providing clarity on what went wrong.

#### Behavior
- The function raises a `TypeError` with the provided `message`. This exception should be caught and handled wherever `_log_input_type_error` is called, allowing for appropriate error handling workflows (e.g., logging, user notifications).

#### Key Design Choices
- **Single Responsibility**: The function adheres to the single responsibility principle by focusing solely on raising a `TypeError` with a specific message. It does not perform any other error handling or logging tasks.
- **Prefix with Underscore**: The function name starts with an underscore (`_`), indicating that it is intended for internal use within the module or package and should not be used as part of the public API.

#### Integration into Larger Applications
In a larger application or module, `_log_input_type_error` can be used in various functions or methods to ensure that type errors are handled in a uniform manner. By centralizing the creation of `TypeError` exceptions, the function aids in maintaining clean and maintainable code, making it easier to modify error handling strategies in the future. This function is particularly useful in applications where input validation and type checking are critical, such as in data processing or user input handling scenarios.

### `contract_validation.py`

#### Function: `validate_core_contracts`

### Summary of `validate_core_contracts` Function

#### Purpose
The `validate_core_contracts` function is a Python decorator designed to enforce type constraints on function or method parameters. It ensures that parameters passed to a function adhere to specified type requirements, which can be either specific classes or interfaces. This is particularly useful in dynamically typed languages like Python, where explicit type checks can help catch bugs and enforce design contracts within the codebase.

#### Behavior and Inputs
- **Inputs:**
  - `param_contracts`: A dictionary mapping parameter names (as strings) to expected types (`Type`). These types can be classes or interfaces that the parameters should either inherit from or be instances of.
  - `allow_none` (optional, default `True`): A boolean flag that determines whether `None` values are acceptable for any parameter. If `False`, a `None` value will trigger a type validation failure.

- **Decorator Logic:**
  - The decorator first inspects the function it decorates to bind and retrieve actual arguments passed to it.
  - It then iterates over each parameter defined in `param_contracts`:
    - If a parameter's value is `None` and `allow_none` is `True`, the validation for that parameter is skipped.
    - If the parameter's value is a class, it checks if this class is a subclass of the expected type.
    - If the parameter's value is an instance, it checks if it is an instance of the expected type.
  - If a parameter fails the type check, and `allow_none` is `False` or the value is not `None`, a type error is logged or raised, detailing the nature of the contract violation.

#### Outputs
- The decorator does not modify the output of the function it wraps. It either allows the function to execute normally if all parameters pass validation or handles the error by logging or raising an exception.

#### Integration and Usage
- This decorator can be applied to any function or method where parameter type validation is required. It is particularly useful in systems where strict type adherence is necessary, such as in large applications with complex interactions between components or when integrating with external systems.
- Example usage is provided in the documentation, showing how to apply the decorator to a class constructor to enforce type constraints on `reader` and `connector` parameters.

#### Design Choices
- The use of a decorator allows for clean separation of validation logic from business logic, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- The optional `allow_none` parameter provides flexibility, allowing developers to decide whether `None` should be treated as a valid value or not, depending on the context.

This function is a part of a larger application or module where type safety and adherence to specified interfaces or base classes are critical, enhancing the robustness and maintainability of the code.

#### Function: `_log_contract_violation`

### Function Documentation: `_log_contract_violation`

#### Purpose
The `_log_contract_violation` function is designed to handle violations of method contracts within an application by raising a `TypeError` with a specific error message. This function is typically used in scenarios where method inputs do not adhere to expected types or values, ensuring that such contract violations are caught and reported clearly and promptly.

#### Inputs
- **method** (`str`): The name of the method where the contract violation occurred. This helps in identifying which part of the code the error originated from.
- **message** (`str`): A detailed message describing the nature of the contract violation. This message is intended to provide clear and actionable information about what went wrong.

#### Behavior
- When called, the function immediately raises a `TypeError` exception, passing along the provided `message`. This interrupts the normal flow of execution and shifts control to the nearest exception handler for `TypeError`.

#### Key Design Choices
- **Use of `TypeError`**: The choice to use `TypeError` for contract violations is significant as it directly relates to errors involving incorrect data types, which is a common form of contract violation.
- **Immediate Exception Raising**: The function opts to raise an exception immediately upon detection of a contract violation, which is a defensive programming practice that helps prevent further execution with invalid state.

#### Integration in Larger Applications
- This function is likely part of a larger error handling or validation framework within the application. It can be used across various parts of the application where method contracts are strictly enforced.
- By centralizing the logic for handling contract violations, the function promotes consistency in error handling and simplifies maintenance and updates to error management strategies.

#### Usage Example
```python
def set_age(age: int):
    if not isinstance(age, int) or age < 0:
        _log_contract_violation("set_age", "Age must be a non-negative integer")
    # Additional logic for setting age
```

This function is crucial for maintaining robustness and reliability in applications, ensuring that all components function correctly within their defined contracts.

### `validate_non_empty.py`

#### Function: `validate_non_empty`

### Summary of `validate_non_empty` Function

#### Purpose
The `validate_non_empty` function is a Python decorator designed to enforce that certain specified parameters of a function are neither `None` nor empty (e.g., empty string, empty list). This is particularly useful in applications where certain inputs are critical for the function's operation and must not be left unspecified or empty.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs:**
  - `param_names`: A list of strings representing the names of the parameters to be validated. These parameters are expected to be present in the function that the decorator is applied to.
  
- **Outputs:**
  - The decorator does not modify the output of the function it wraps. However, it does raise a `ValueError` if any of the specified parameters are found to be empty or `None`.

#### Key Logic and Design Choices
- **Parameter Binding and Validation:**
  - The decorator uses the `signature` from the `inspect` module to bind the provided arguments and keyword arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`) to the parameter names of the function it decorates.
  - It then checks each specified parameter (from `param_names`) to ensure the value is not empty using a helper function `_is_empty`. If an empty value is found, a logging function `_log_empty_violation` is called before raising a `ValueError`.

- **Error Handling and Logging:**
  - If a violation (empty parameter) is detected, the function logs detailed information about the violation using `_log_empty_violation`, which includes the function name and a message indicating which parameter was empty and what value it had.
  - Subsequently, a `ValueError` is raised to halt the function execution, ensuring that the function does not proceed with invalid input values.

#### Integration into Larger Applications
- **Use Case in Data Handling and Validation:**
  - This decorator can be particularly useful in data processing or web applications where certain inputs are required for the correct functioning of a method (e.g., file paths, user inputs in forms).
  - It helps in early detection and reporting of errors due to missing or incorrect inputs, thereby improving the robustness of the application.

- **Ease of Use:**
  - By using a decorator, the validation logic is abstracted away from the core business logic of the function, making the code cleaner and easier to read. It also reduces redundancy by centralizing common validation checks.

#### Example Usage
```python
@validate_non_empty(["path", "columns"])
def load_data(path: str, columns: list[str]):
    # Function logic here
    pass
```
In the above example, the `load_data` function will only execute if `path` and `columns` are neither `None` nor empty, ensuring the function operates with valid inputs.

#### Function: `_log_empty_violation`

### Function Documentation: `_log_empty_violation`

#### Purpose
The `_log_empty_violation` function is designed to handle error reporting for specific violations within an application, particularly when a certain condition expected by the method is not met. It centralizes the error handling by raising a `ValueError` with a custom message, making it easier to maintain and manage error reporting consistency across different parts of the application.

#### Inputs
- `method` (str): The name of the method where the violation occurred. This parameter is included to provide context in the error handling process but is not directly used in the current implementation of the function.
- `message` (str): A descriptive message that details the nature of the violation. This message is passed directly to the `ValueError` to inform the user or developer about the specific issue.

#### Behavior
- The function raises a `ValueError` with the provided `message`. This exception needs to be handled by the calling code, typically in a try-except block where the function is invoked.

#### Key Design Choices
- The function uses a straightforward approach to error handling by raising an exception, which is a common pattern in Python for managing errors and exceptional situations.
- The naming convention (`_log_empty_violation`) and the use of an underscore prefix suggest that this function is intended for internal use within a module or package, rather than being part of a public API.

#### Integration in a Larger Application
- `_log_empty_violation` can be used across various parts of an application to ensure that any violations of expected conditions are handled uniformly.
- It helps in debugging and maintenance by providing a consistent method of error reporting, which can be particularly useful in larger applications where different components might otherwise handle errors inconsistently.
- The function's implementation could be extended in the future to include logging to external systems or integrating with application monitoring tools, depending on the needs of the application it is part of.

#### Function: `_is_empty`

### Function: `_is_empty`

#### Purpose
The `_is_empty` function is designed to determine if a given input value is considered "empty" based on several predefined criteria. This utility function is typically used to validate or check the presence of data in various data structures and simple data types.

#### Inputs
- `value`: The input parameter `value` can be of several types including `None`, string, list, dictionary, set, or tuple.

#### Outputs
- Returns a boolean value:
  - `True` if the input is considered empty.
  - `False` otherwise.

#### Key Logic
The function checks if the input `value` matches any of the following conditions deemed as empty:
- `None`: Represents the absence of a value.
- An empty string `""`: A string with no characters.
- An empty list `[]`: A list with no elements.
- An empty dictionary `{}`: A dictionary with no key-value pairs.
- An empty set `set()`: A set with no elements.
- An empty tuple `()`: A tuple with no elements.

The function uses the logical OR operator (`or`) to combine these checks into a single return statement.

#### Design Choices
- The function name is prefixed with an underscore (`_`), suggesting that it is intended for internal use within a module or package, rather than being part of the public API.
- The use of multiple or conditions in a single return statement provides a concise and efficient way to evaluate the emptiness of the input.

#### Application Context
This function is useful in scenarios where data validation is required before processing. It helps in simplifying checks for "no data" across functions that handle different types of inputs. For example, in data processing or loading functions, it can be used to quickly determine if input data needs to be skipped or handled differently when it's empty. This utility can be part of larger applications where data integrity and checks are frequently required, such as in web development, data analysis, or backend services.
